# Class Creation Worksheet

Build a `Thermostat` class from scratch, adding features at each level.

---

## Level 1 🌱 — Define the Class

### 1) Thermostat Basics

In `Thermostat.java`, create a class with:

- Private instance variables:
  - `double currentTemp` — the current temperature
  - `double targetTemp` — the desired temperature
  - `boolean isHeating` — whether the heater is on
- A parameterized constructor that takes all three values
- A `toString()` method that returns something like:
  ```
  Thermostat [current: 68.0, target: 72.0, heating: true]
  ```

Test by creating a `Thermostat` in a `main` method and printing it.

---

## Level 2 🌿 — Accessors and Mutators

### 2) Getters

Add accessor methods for all three instance variables:
- `double getCurrentTemp()`
- `double getTargetTemp()`
- `boolean getIsHeating()`

### 3) Setters with Validation

Add mutator methods:
- `void setTargetTemp(double t)` — only sets if `t` is between 50 and 90 (inclusive)
- `void setIsHeating(boolean h)` — sets the heating mode

---

## Level 3 🌳 — Behavior Methods

### 4) Adjust Temperature

Add a void method `void adjustTemp()` that:
- If `isHeating` is true and `currentTemp < targetTemp`, increase `currentTemp` by 1.0
- If `isHeating` is false and `currentTemp > targetTemp`, decrease `currentTemp` by 1.0
- Otherwise, do nothing

### 5) Check Target

Add a non-void method `boolean isAtTarget()` that returns `true` if `currentTemp` equals `targetTemp`.

### 6) Set Mode

Add a void method `void setMode(String mode)` that:
- If `mode` is `"heat"` (case-insensitive), sets `isHeating` to true
- If `mode` is `"cool"` (case-insensitive), sets `isHeating` to false

**Hint:** Use `.equalsIgnoreCase()` so inputs like `"HEAT"` or `"Cool"` also work.

---

## Level 4 🌲 — Constructor Overloading

### 7) Default Constructor

Add a default (no-argument) constructor that sets:
- `currentTemp` to 70.0
- `targetTemp` to 70.0
- `isHeating` to false

### 8) Overloaded Method

Add an overloaded method `adjustTemp` that:
- Increases `currentTemp` by `amount` if `isHeating` is true
- Decreases `currentTemp` by `amount` if `isHeating` is false

---

## Level 5 🌴 — Driver Simulation

### 9) ThermostatDriver

In `ThermostatDriver.java`, write a program that:

1. Uses a `Scanner` to ask the user for:
   - A target temperature (as a `double`)
   - A mode (`"heat"` or `"cool"`)
2. Creates two thermostats:
   - One using the default constructor
   - One using the user's input (set `currentTemp` to 60.0 for heat mode, or 85.0 for cool mode)
3. Uses a while loop to call `adjustTemp()` on each thermostat until both reach their target
4. Prints the state of each thermostat after every adjustment step
5. After the simulation, prints how many total steps it took

Example output:
```
Enter target temperature (50-90): 72.0
Enter mode (heat/cool): heat
Step 1: Thermostat [current: 70.0, target: 70.0, heating: false] | Thermostat [current: 61.0, target: 72.0, heating: true]
Step 2: Thermostat [current: 70.0, target: 70.0, heating: false] | Thermostat [current: 62.0, target: 72.0, heating: true]
...
Done in 12 steps.
```
